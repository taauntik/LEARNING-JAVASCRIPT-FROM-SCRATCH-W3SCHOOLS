        External scripts are practical when the same code is used
        in different web pages.

        Javascript have the file extension [.js].

        To use an external script, put the name of the script file in the src
        (source) attribute of a <script> tag:
    -->
    <!-- Example: -->
    <script src="script.js"></script>

        External Javascript advantages: [7th]

        Placing scripts in external files have some advantages.

        1. It separates HTML and Js code.
        2. It makes HTML and javascript code easier to read and maintainable.
        3. Cached Javascript files can speed up loads.

        To add several script files to one page - use several script tags:
        Example:

        <script src="myScript1.js"></script>
        <script src="myScript2.js"></script>
     -->

     <!--
        External References: [8th]

        An external script can be referenced in 3 different ways:
        1. With a full URL (a full web address)
        2. With a file path (like .js)
        3. With out any path

        This example uses a full Url to link to myScript.js:
        <script src="https://www.w3schools.com/js/myScript.js"></script>

        This example uses a file path to link to myScript.js:
        <script src="/js/myScript.js"></script>

        This example uses no path to link to myScript.js:
        <script src="myScript.js"></script>
